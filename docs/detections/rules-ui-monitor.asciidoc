== Monitoring and troubleshooting rule executions

To view a summary of all rule executions, such as failures and last execution
times, select the *Rule Monitoring* tab in the *All rules* table (*Security* ->
*Detections* -> *Manage detection rules*).

For detailed information on a rule, its generated alerts and errors, click on
a rule name in the *All rules* table.

=== Troubleshoot missing alerts

When a rule fails to run close to its scheduled time, some alerts may be
missing. There are a number of steps you can perform to try and resolve this
issue.

If you see `Gaps` in the All rules table or on the Rule details page
for a small number of rules, you can increase those rules'
`Additional look-back time` (*Detection rules* page -> the rule's *All actions* button (*...*) -> *Edit rule settings* -> *Schedule* -> _Additional look-back time_).

If you see gaps for numerous rules:

* If you restarted {kib} when many rules were activated, try deactivating them
and then reactivating them in small batches at staggered intervals. This
ensures {kib} does not attempt to run all the rules at the same time.
* Consider adding another {kib} instance to your environment.

Even if your rule runs at its scheduled time, there might still be missing alerts if your ingestion pipeline delay is greater than your rule interval + additional look-back time. As such, it is recommended that you use caution when creating custom rules with interval + additional look-back time values smaller than 6 minutes.

You can also eliminate ingestion pipeline delay by specifying the `Timestamp override` field value to `event.digested` in <<rule-ui-advanced-params, advanced settings>> during rule creation. The detection engine uses the value from the `event.digested` field as the timestamp of when to execute the rule. For example, if an event occurred at 10:01 and was ingested in {es} at 10:10, the rule you created to detect that event would execute at 10:10 and generate an alert.
